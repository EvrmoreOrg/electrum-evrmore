# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report security issues send an email to hans_schm1dt@protonmail.com.

The following keys may be used to communicate sensitive information to developers:

| Name | Fingerprint |
|------|-------------|

You can import a key by running the following command with that
individualâ€™s fingerprint: `gpg --recv-keys "<fingerprint>"`
Ensure that you put quotes around fingerprints containing spaces.

These public keys can also be found in the Electrum git repository,
in the top-level `pubkeys` folder.
